Prerequisites
-------------

To install ALPSCore, the following is needed:

 1. C++ compiler: g++ >= 4.8.1 OR Intel >= 15.0 OR Clang >= 3.2
 2. CMake >= 3.1 (*NOTE*: CMake 3.6.0 on Mac has a [known problem](https://github.com/ALPSCore/ALPSCore/wiki/Known-problems-and-workarounds))
 3. HDF5 library 1.8.x (*NOTE*: HDF5 1.10 has a [known problem](https://github.com/ALPSCore/ALPSCore/wiki/Known-problems-and-workarounds#some-hdf5-related-tests-fail))
 4. Boost >= 1.56.0
 5. Eigen 3.3.4 (can be requested to be downloaded automatically)

Optional requirements:

 6. An MPI library and headers for compiling multi-cpu versions of the libraries.
 7. Doxygen for creating low-level documentation.


Installing pre-packaged ALPSCore
--------------------------------

 1. MacOS via [macports](http://macports.org)

        $ sudo port install alpscore

 2. Linux:

    a. [Debian package](https://github.com/cmsi/ma-alpscore)

    b. [Gentoo packaging](https://github.com/ALPSCore/packaging/blob/master/gentoo)


For other systems: please file an issue to
[let us know your system](https://github.com/ALPSCore/ALPSCore/issues?q=is%3Aopen)
and we will try to add package files.


Manual source installation
--------------------------

### Obtaining the source code ###

The ALPSCore package can be obtained by following methods:

* Clone Git repository at https://github.com/ALPSCore/ALPSCore.git:

        $ git clone https://github.com/ALPSCore/ALPSCore.git
        $ cd ALPSCore

* From release tarball:

  1. Download a release tarball from
     [https://github.com/ALPSCore/ALPSCore/releases](https://github.com/ALPSCore/ALPSCore/releases).

  1. Rename the downloaded tarball to ALPSCore.tar.gz (or ALPSCore.zip, if
     you chose the zip version), unpack it and change into the created directory:

            $ tar -xzf ALPSCore.tar.gz
            $ cd ALPSCore*/

### Compilation ###

The ALPSCore library uses CMake as its build system.

1. Create a build directory and change to it:

       $ mkdir build
       $ cd build

2. Next, generate the ALPSCore build. The simplest build with reasonable
   defaults is generated by:

       $ cmake .. -DALPS_INSTALL_EIGEN=yes -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/where/to/install/ALPSCore

   This will attempt to download Eigen3 and co-install it along with ALPSCore.

   **Alternatively**, if you already have Eigen3 installed, you may pass its
   location to the build:

       $ cmake .. -DEIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/Eigen3/headers \
                  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/where/to/install/ALPSCore

   There are many CMake and environment variables affecting ALPSCore build,
   which you can pass using `cmake -Dvariable=value` syntax, please refer to the
   [corresponding Wiki page](https://github.com/ALPSCore/ALPSCore/wiki/CMake-and-environment-variables-affecting-ALPSCore-build).

   You can also have a look at the 
   [build.jenkins.sh](https://github.com/ALPSCore/ALPSCore/blob/master/common/build/build.jenkins.sh)
   file in the directory [common/build](https://github.com/ALPSCore/ALPSCore/tree/master/common/build).
   This outlines some of the common options used by our automatic build system.

   **NOTE:** You _must_ compile the ALPSCore libraries and all your codes which
   depend on the ALPScore libraries with the same C++ standard for ABI
   compatibility. At the very least, do not mix C++03 and C++11 code.  More
   detailed information about setting C++ standard version is available on
   [the wiki](https://github.com/ALPSCore/ALPSCore/wiki/Choice-of-CXX-standard).

   For advanced users: If you do not wish to install all ALPSCore components,
   please refer to the wiki page
   [Selecting ALPSCore components](https://github.com/ALPSCore/ALPSCore/wiki/Selecting-ALPSCore-components).

3. Once the build tree successfully generated, perform the build:

       $ make

   on multicore machines with enough memory you can also run

       $ make -j njobs

   with `njobs` the number of parallel jobs to run the compilation in parallel.

4. Run the tests:

       $ make test

5. and install ALPSCore:

       $ make install

   The ALPScore will be installed in the directory specified in step 3
   (``/where/to/install/ALPSCore`` in this example).

### Troubleshooting ###

1. If your build generation seems to pick up the wrong Boost library,
   the following may help (note the mixed-case `Boost_` in some of the arguments!):

       $ cmake .. -DBOOST_ROOT=/path/to/boost \
                  -DBoost_NO_SYSTEM_PATHS=ON \
                  -DBoost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE=ON

2. To point CMake to the correct location of HDF5 library, set environment variable
   `HDF5_ROOT=/path/to/hdf5` prior to CMake invocation.

3. If your CMake run fails with a message `In source builds are disabled.  Please use a separate build directory`,
   first make sure that you are *not* indeed attempting to build in the source
   directory. The error may be a lasting effect of a previous attempt at an
   in-source build, see
   [CMake FAQ](https://cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_FAQ#I_run_an_out-of-source_build_but_CMake_generates_in-source_anyway._Why.3F).

   You should remove CMake-generated files from the source directory and redo
   the build. For example, this way (from the build directory):

        $ mv ../CMakeLists.txt ../save_CMakeLists.txt
        $ rm -rf ../CMake*
        $ mv ../save_CMakeLists.txt ../CMakeLists.txt

4. On most high performance computers with non-standard environments, e.g.
   crays/blue genes, you will get the best results by using the wrapper
   compilers and enabling static linking (see ALPS_BUILD_TYPE in
   [CMake variables](https://github.com/ALPSCore/ALPSCore/wiki/CMake-and-environment-variables-affecting-ALPSCore-build).

5. See also a page listing [known problems](https://github.com/ALPSCore/ALPSCore/wiki/Known-problems-and-workarounds).


Build your project with ALPSCore
--------------------------------

To use ALPSCore, your project must utilize CMake build system. Add the
following lines to your project's ``CMakeLists.txt``:

        # Not strictly necessary, but will create executables that are
        # aware of ALPSCore location
        SET(CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH TRUE)

        # Request the ALPSCore package:
        find_package(ALPSCore)
        # (optionally, components can be also listed, like this:)
        # find_package(ALPSCore accumulators params)

        # Use ALPSCore_LIBRARIES variable to link to ALPSCore
        target_link_libraries(your_project_target ${ALPSCore_LIBRARIES})

You can see a [`CMakeLists.txt`](https://github.com/ALPSCore/ALPSCore/blob/master/tutorials/mc/ising_mc/CMakeLists.txt)
in an [example project](https://github.com/ALPSCore/ALPSCore/tree/master/tutorials/mc/ising_mc)
at https://github.com/ALPSCore/ALPSCore/tree/master/tutorials/mc/ising_mc . To build the project:

        $ mkdir ~/alpscore-tutorial
        $ cd ~/alpscore-tutorial
        $ env ALPSCore_DIR=/where/to/install/ALPSCore cmake /path/to/the/tutorials/mc/ising_mc
        $ make
